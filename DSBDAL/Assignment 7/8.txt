Space tourism represents a burgeoning industry that promises to make space exploration accessible to private individuals and civilian travelers. Companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are pioneering efforts to offer suborbital and orbital spaceflight experiences to paying customers. Advances in reusable rocket technology and spacecraft design have lowered the barriers to entry for space tourism, opening up new opportunities for adventurous travelers and space enthusiasts. While space tourism remains in its infancy, the prospect of experiencing weightlessness and witnessing Earth from space has captured the imagination of people around the world. The commercialization of space travel heralds a new era of human exploration beyond the confines of Earth.
