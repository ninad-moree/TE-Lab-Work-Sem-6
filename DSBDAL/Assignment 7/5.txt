Space-based observatories have revolutionized our understanding of the universe by providing unparalleled views of distant celestial objects and phenomena. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, has captured breathtaking images of galaxies, nebulae, and other cosmic wonders, fundamentally altering our perception of the cosmos. Complementing Hubble, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope have unveiled the universe in different wavelengths, revealing the hidden dynamics of black holes, supernovae, and star-forming regions. The synergy between these great observatories has propelled astronomical research to new heights, inspiring awe and expanding our knowledge of the cosmos.
