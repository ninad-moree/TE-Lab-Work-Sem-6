The exploration of exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of the universe and the potential for life beyond Earth. Utilizing advanced telescopes and detection methods, scientists have identified thousands of exoplanets orbiting distant stars. The search for habitable worlds focuses on planets within the "habitable zone," where conditions may support liquid water and, potentially, life as we know it. Recent discoveries, such as the TRAPPIST-1 system, have unveiled multiple Earth-sized planets orbiting a single star, raising tantalizing possibilities for the existence of extraterrestrial life. Understanding the diversity of exoplanetary systems is essential for unraveling the mysteries of planetary formation and the prevalence of life in the cosmos.
