Satellites play a pivotal role in monitoring Earth's dynamic climate system and environmental changes on a global scale. By collecting data on atmospheric composition, ocean temperatures, land cover, and other vital parameters, satellites provide invaluable insights into climate trends and phenomena. These observations are instrumental in assessing the impacts of climate change, informing policymakers, and guiding mitigation efforts. With advances in satellite technology and data analysis techniques, our ability to monitor Earth's climate system with unprecedented detail continues to improve. Satellites serve as indispensable tools for understanding the complexities of our planet's climate and facilitating informed decision-making to address environmental challenges.
