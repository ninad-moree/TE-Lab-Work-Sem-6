The Moon, Earth's closest celestial neighbor, holds vast potential for scientific discovery and resource utilization. Recent lunar missions have confirmed the presence of water ice in permanently shadowed regions near the lunar poles, offering a critical resource for future exploration and habitation. In addition to water, the Moon harbors valuable minerals and rare elements that could support sustained human presence and enable economic activities such as mining and manufacturing. Establishing infrastructure on the Moon represents a crucial step toward realizing long-term human space exploration goals, including missions to Mars and beyond. Lunar prospecting holds the key to unlocking the Moon's resources and shaping the future of space exploration.
