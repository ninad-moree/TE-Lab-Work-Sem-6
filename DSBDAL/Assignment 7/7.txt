Black holes, regions of spacetime where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape, stand as some of the most mysterious and fascinating objects in the cosmos. Formed from the collapse of massive stars or through the mergers of galaxies, black holes come in various sizes, from stellar-mass to supermassive behemoths that lurk at the centers of galaxies. Despite their ominous reputation, black holes play a crucial role in shaping the universe, influencing the evolution of galaxies and driving the formation of cosmic structures. The study of black holes continues to challenge our understanding of physics and the nature of space and time.
