The proliferation of space debris poses a significant and escalating risk to satellites, spacecraft, and crewed missions in Earth's orbit. Space debris, consisting of defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragments from previous space missions, poses collision hazards to operational spacecraft and critical infrastructure such as the International Space Station. With millions of debris objects orbiting Earth, the potential for catastrophic collisions and cascading debris events, known as the Kessler syndrome, presents a pressing concern for space agencies and commercial operators. Efforts to mitigate the threat of space debris include tracking and cataloging debris objects, developing debris removal technologies, and implementing guidelines for responsible space operations. Addressing the challenge of space debris is essential for ensuring the long-term sustainability of space activities and preserving access to outer space for future generations.
