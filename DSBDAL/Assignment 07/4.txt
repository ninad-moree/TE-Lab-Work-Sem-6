Dark matter remains one of the most enigmatic phenomena in modern astrophysics, comprising the majority of matter in the universe yet eluding direct detection. Its existence is inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter and cosmic structures, but its precise nature remains elusive. Various theories propose exotic particles as potential candidates for dark matter, yet experimental efforts to detect them have thus far yielded no conclusive results. Understanding the nature of dark matter is essential for comprehending the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe. Ongoing observational and theoretical research endeavors aim to unravel the mystery of dark matter and shed light on fundamental questions about the cosmos.
